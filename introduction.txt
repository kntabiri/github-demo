My name is Kojo Nketsia-Tabiri. I am 27 years old and currently live in the United States.
I have three brothers. I love to play music and dance in my car.
I am currently in a serious relationship with my girlfriend, Nana Sarfowah. 
It has been a beautiful journey with her and hope to continue on till eternity.
I graduated from the University of Virginia, with a Bachelors of Arts in Biology.
Initially, I wanted to become a pediatrician but certain things happened along the way.
During the pandemic, I discovered my interest in data in general and I have not stopped learning about it.
Very soon, I will become a Data Specialist or Analyst in one of the biggest IT companies in the world.
Until then, the work to discovery still continues.
